# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This demo is supposed to be showing how we utilize MCPs within the wider development process utilizing Claude Code itself.

Watch Claude Code use MCP servers to build a Pokémon fan site:

    * Claude Code generates a polished React UI with Tailwind
    * Context7 provides current React/Tailwind documentation
    * Interactive Pokémon cards with stats and ratings
    * Application provides a filterable solution for different types of Pokémon.
    * When clicking on cards it displays the attributes of the Pokémon.
